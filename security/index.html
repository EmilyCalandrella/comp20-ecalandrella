	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	The first issue I found was that all other websites are given access to Not Uber. This is dangerous; only sites that the creator of the website knows will need to access it should be allowed, instead of granting access to any website. Another issue is that the data stored in the mongo database is accessable by anyone who knows what to type as the URL. Finally, the source code of the website itself can be changed by anyone, which changes what Not Uber displays.

<!-- Notes
- response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); - probably should not allow all origins
- https://hans-moleman.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json?username[$ne]=1    (allows you to view all the data)
- curl --data "username=<script>alert('Hacked by Emily')</script>&lat=1&lng=2" https://hans-moleman.herokuapp.com/rides  (added an alert saying "Hacked by Emily") when the page first loads)
