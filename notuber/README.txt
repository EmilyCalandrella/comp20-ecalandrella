All aspects of the lab have been completed. However, the car markers were not created as efficiently as they could be - I should have figured out how to create an array of cars and use a loop to display all six of them, but I'm tired so I just re-typed the code I used for the first car six times. I'll try to improve that during Part 2 of this project.
I discussed a couple issues on Piazza but did not collaborate with anyone in person.
I spent four hours working on this lab.
