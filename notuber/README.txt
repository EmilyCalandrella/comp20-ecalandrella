Lab 8:
All aspects of the lab have been completed. However, the car markers were not created as efficiently as they could be - I should have figured out how to create an array of cars and use a loop to display all six of them, but I'm tired so I just re-typed the code I used for the first car six times. I'll try to improve that during Part 2 of this project.
I discussed a couple issues on Piazza but did not collaborate with anyone in person.
I spent four hours working on this lab.

Lab 10:
I did not complete every part of the lab. I was able to determine my geolocation but did not successfully make a request to the Ride-Hailing API, or finish the subsequent steps. 
I did not collaborate with anyone.
I spent about 6 hours on this lab so far.

Lab 10 Update:
The rest of the lab is now complete. I spent about four more hours on it and did not collaborate with anyone.
